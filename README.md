This page is devoted for my software engineering course

## What Software Engineering means to me?

```markdown
Software Engineering for me is the art and science of designing, 
constructing, and maintaing general computer software applications.
It means being creative in designing certain software, while also 
using logic in the process.

## Pragmatic Programmer

### Chapter 1

There are many several points that I found important in this chapter.
First of all, the chapter talks about taking responsibility on the work
that you are going to commit to. It is important to make a call based on
your own ethics and judgment. If the work does not seem to match your personal
judgment, do NOT take the responsibility because that means you are also
responsible of the outcome. If you take the responsibility and the outcome
is not what to be expected, do not make excuses, provide options on
what can make it work or better. The chapter also talks about the disorder 
of the system, or the disorganized code. It's interesting how the authors compare this
to "broken windows." What interests me even more is the stone soup story. 
It gives a clear picture of how important teamwork is, and also how effective
small things can be. Furthermore, the author talks about the good-enough code.
I learned that good enough code does not necessarily mean sloppy and poorly produced
code. Once the program meets the requirements of the users, there is no need to
further develope the code. You just need to know when to stop. More importantly,
what I found the most important in this chapter are the knowledge portfolio and
the communication. It is interesting on how closely related investors and programmers
are. We developers invest every day using our knowledge, just like the investors.
For the communication part, I think it is the most critical part of software engineering
because you first need to know what your audience needs or interested in before
planning out what to say or to be presented. Then, once you are already in process,
communicating with the audience early by showing them your drafts on what you are doing
or planning to do helps you to get feedback from them early. That way, you can fix things
early in the process.

### Chapter 2

Chapter 2 is quite a long chapter. It starts with a topic of the bad of duplication and the 
important of documentation. Documenting your code not only tells other people what your program 
does, it also helps you to recognize your own code. Sometimes, after you finished a project in 
a while, you tend to forget what you have coded, or the purpose of the project. Also, having 
duplicate codes is bad because not only is it difficult to make a change without ruining the whole 
project, it is also a waste of time to go back and change the same code in every method. This is 
why decoupling is encouraged. The book related the term Orthogonality to the independent or 
decoupling of each class of the code. There are many benefits to using Orthonality. The major 
two are gaining productivity and reducing risk. As mentioned before, having a method that can be 
reused over and over again can save a lot of time. All changes are localized, so the development 
time and testing time are reduced. Having these in mind, applying them to the real work can be 
very effective. Using the same analogy on project teams, we can divide the team into small groups 
and assign each group a specific task, so that we all do not get confused of what to do. Having 
this kind of organization not only reduces risk of making change of something in the project, 
it also reduces time of going about to discuss the change. One topic that I found interesting 
would be the tracer bullets analogy. Applying the approach of aimming the target before firing 
can be very helpful anf effective to a lot of developers. With the approach, developers can have 
a better feel for their progress because their users are able to see their progress. Each and every 
iteration the developers commit, the users can go ahead and see whether it is what they want. 
This, I think, is also part of commnication. Although it is not a direct one, but the result 
is about the same. Being able to see what the developer is doing, users can make a comment and 
suggest or require a change to the program. Getting feedback early is always a good thing.
The last topic I found very important in this chapter is the estimation. Whether it be estimating 
a certain value or a period of time to get something done. Giving an estimation of how long you 
will be working on your project can be critical to not just you as a developer, but also to the 
users that wait for their product to be finished. Another important aspect of the estimation is 
it keeps you organized and not lose track of what you are doing. Making a schedule of what needs 
to be done in estimately how many days can be very helpful with those lacking time management.
