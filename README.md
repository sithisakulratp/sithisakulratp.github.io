## What Software Engineering means to me?

```markdown
Software Engineering for me is the art and science of designing, 
constructing, and maintaing general computer software applications.
It means being creative in designing certain software, while also 
using logic in the process.

### Chapter 1

There are many several points that I found important in this chapter.
First of all, the chapter talks about taking responsibility on the work
that you are going to commit to. It is important to make a call based on
your own ethics and judgment. If the work does not seem to match your personal
judgment, do NOT take the responsibility because that means you are also
responsible of the outcome. If you take the responsibility and the outcome
is not what to be expected, do not make excuses, provide options on
what can make it work or better. The chapter also talks about the disorder 
of the system, or the disorganized code. It's interesting how the authors compare this
to "broken windows." What interests me even more is the stone soup story. 
It gives a clear picture of how important teamwork is, and also how effective
small things can be. Furthermore, the author talks about the good-enough code.
I learned that good enough code does not necessarily mean sloppy and poorly produced
code. Once the program meets the requirements of the users, there is no need to
further develope the code. You just need to know when to stop. More importantly,
what I found the most important in this chapter are the knowledge portfolio and
the communication. It is interesting on how closely related investors and programmers
are. We developers invest every day using our knowledge, just like the investors.
For the communication part, I think it is the most critical part of software engineering
because you first need to know what your audience needs or interested in before
planning out what to say or to be presented. Then, once you are already in process,
communicating with the audience early by showing them your drafts on what you are doing
or planning to do helps you to get feedback from them early. That way, you can fix things
early in the process.
