<h2>CSCI 260 Software Engineering Spring 2017</h2>
<p>This page is devoted for my software engineering course</p>

<h2>What Software Engineering means to me</h2>
<p>Software Engineering for me is the art and science of designing, constructing,
    and maintaining general computer software applications. It means being creative
    in designing certain software, while also using logic in the process.</p>

<h2>Pragmatic Programmer</h2>
<h3>Chapter 1</h3>
<p>There are many several points that I found important in this chapter.
    First of all, the chapter talks about taking responsibility on the work
    that you are going to commit to. It is important to make a call based on
    your own ethics and judgment. If the work does not seem to match your personal
    judgment, do NOT take the responsibility because that means you are also
    responsible of the outcome. If you take the responsibility and the outcome
    is not what to be expected, do not take make excuses, provide options on
    what can make it work or better. The chapter also talks about the disorder
    of the system, or the disorganized code. It's interesting how the authors compare this
    to "broken windows." What interests me even more is the stone soup story.
    It gives a clear picture of how important teamwork is, and also how effective
    small things can be. Furthermore, the author talks about the good-enough code.
    I learned that good enough code does not necessarily mean sloppy and poorly produced
    code. Once the program meets the requirements of the users, there is no need to
    further develope the code. You just need to know when to stop. More importantly,
    what I found the most important in this chapter are the knowledge portfolio and
    the communication. It is interesting on how closely related investors and programmers
    are. We developers invest every day using our knowledge, just like the investors.
    For the communication part, I think it is the most critical part of software engineering
    because you first need to know what your audience needs or interested in before
    planning out what to say or to be presented. Then, once you are already in process,
    communicating with the audience early by showing them your drafts on what you are doing
    or planning to do, so you can get feedback from them early. That way, you can fix things
    early in the process.</p>
